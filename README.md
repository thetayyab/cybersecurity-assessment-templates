# Cybersecurity Assessment Templates (Sanitised)

This repository contains sanitised Excel templates I created for cybersecurity assessment and tracking.

## Included templates
1) Vulnerability Matrix (Excel)
- Track findings end-to-end: severity, affected component, risk description, recommended mitigation, status.

2) Cyber Posture Evaluation (Excel)
- Self-assessment questionnaire format (Yes/Partial/No/Not sure) to identify control gaps and prioritise improvements.

## Notes
- These templates are shared as portfolio work samples.
- Any organisation-specific details have been removed or replaced with placeholders.
